I am interested in representation learning and integration across various modalities, aiming to enable AI systems to comprehend the world more comprehensively. Currently, I’m exploring state space models (SSMs) for video-related tasks, which show promise for improving efficiency and modeling long-range dependencies in sequence data.</p> <p>If you’re interested in collaborating on research projects, feel free to contact me :)</p> </body></html>
